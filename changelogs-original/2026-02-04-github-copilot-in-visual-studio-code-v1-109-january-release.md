# GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code v1.109 – January Release

## Overview
This January 2026 release brings significant improvements to GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code with agent-driven workflows, improvements to agent session management, and the introduction of agent support for Claude by Anthropic – right in your IDE.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- This January 2026 release brings significant improvements to GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code with agent-driven workflows, improvements to agent session management, and the introduction of agent support for Claude by Anthropic – right in your IDE.

### Agent extensibility (models + integrations)
- Claude agent support is in public preview and enables delegating tasks to Anthropic’s official Claude Agent SDK using Claude models from your GitHub Copilot subscription.
- Richer chat interactions with MCP apps enable more tool-driven, interactive Copilot experiences inside VS Code.

### Copilot Chat & UX
- Faster, snappier chat experience with improved streaming responsiveness.
- Higher-quality reasoning results for more reliable answers and better task execution.
- Better visibility into model reasoning with thinking tokens and agents that ask questions instead of assuming.
- Revamped editor inline chat to make in-context Copilot interactions feel more natural and effective while you code.

### Multiagent development & session management
- Improved agent session management makes it easier to delegate work across: Copilot Claude Local agents Background agents Cloud agents
- Seamless handoff and intervention: jump into agent work when needed, without disrupting momentum.
- Agent status indicator shows sessions needing attention, subagents run in parallel for faster completion.

### Copilot agent customization
- Agent orchestrations enable building repeatable workflows tailored to your team or project.
- Agent Skills plus org-wide customization help ensure more consistent outcomes across developers and environments.

### Agent optimizations (smarter + faster)
- Copilot Memory helps agents work smarter by retaining relevant context across interactions.
- Faster code search via external indexing improves retrieval speed and responsiveness during large-repo development.

### Agent security & trust
- Terminal command sandboxing increases confidence when agents propose or execute commands (experimental, macOS/Linux only) .
- Effective auto-approval rules improve safety and control for agent-driven actions while reducing unnecessary prompts.
- Terminal lifecycle improvements give better control over background commands with timeout, await, and kill capabilities.

### Related VS Code productivity updates (not Copilot-related)
- Integrated browser : Test and run apps without leaving the editor.
- Terminal enhancements : Quality-of-life improvements for smoother, more reliable terminal usage.
- Coding & editor improvements : Multiple refinements to everyday coding flow.
- Extensions & API updates : New capabilities for extension authors to build richer experiences.
- Happy coding!
