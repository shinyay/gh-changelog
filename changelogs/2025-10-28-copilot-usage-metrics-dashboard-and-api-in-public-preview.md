# Copilot usage metrics dashboard and API in public preview

## Overview
The Copilot usage metrics dashboard and corresponding API are available in public preview for GitHub Enterprise.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- The Copilot usage metrics dashboard and corresponding API are available in public preview for GitHub Enterprise.
- The AI era of software development isn’t about are teams using AI, but rather how well are they using it?
- The GitHub Copilot usage metrics dashboard and API, now in public preview for GitHub Enterprise customers using Copilot, helps you answer that question with data.
- You can now see how Copilot adoption and engagement in the IDE varies across both your enterprise and your users to understand who’s using it, where, and how.

### What’s included in the public preview
- The Copilot usage metrics dashboard gives enterprise administrators and billing managers direct visibility into Copilot usage and adoption under the Insights tab. The dashboard provides an aggregated enterprise view, while the NDJSON download or API offer user-level granularity for deeper analysis.
- In this public preview, you’ll find metrics including:
- Daily and weekly active users across GitHub Copilot IDE modes, including agent mode.
- Agent adoption across your user base.
- Lines of code added and deleted across all IDE modes.
- Language and model usage patterns across IDEs.
- These metrics help you understand:
- Overall usage and adoption : Review indicators like weekly usage provide a broad view of Copilot adoption across your enterprise.
- Specific model, feature, and language usage : See which AI models and programming languages are most utilized by your teams, highlighting areas for even greater value.
- Agent adoption percentage : Track how many developers are using Copilot for advanced tasks like refactoring, debugging, and complex problem solving. High agent adoption signals a shift toward truly transformative coding.
- Together, these are foundational metrics showing who’s adopting Copilot, how consistently, and what that usage looks like across your enterprise.
