# GitHub Code Quality in public preview

## Overview
GitHub Code Quality is now available in public preview! It turns every pull request into an opportunity to improve. With in-context findings, one-click Copilot fixes, and reliability and maintainability scores, you spend less time chasing nits and more time building. It’s there when you need it most, surfacing quality issues both in the pull request and the backlog so you can fix technical debt on your schedule.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- GitHub Code Quality is now available in public preview! It turns every pull request into an opportunity to improve. With in-context findings, one-click Copilot fixes, and reliability and maintainability scores, you spend less time chasing nits and more time building.
