# Managing Copilot Business in enterprise is now generally available

## Overview
Enterprise owners with GitHub Enterprise Cloud can assign Copilot Business licenses inside an enterprise account independent of granting any organizational access. This experience provides a flexible, more scalable Copilot Business licensing model to enterprises without requiring a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license per user.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- Enterprise owners with GitHub Enterprise Cloud can assign Copilot Business licenses inside an enterprise account independent of granting any organizational access.
