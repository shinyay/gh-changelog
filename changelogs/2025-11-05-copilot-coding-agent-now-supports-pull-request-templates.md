# Copilot coding agent now supports pull request templates

## Overview
Copilot coding agent is our asynchronous, autonomous background agent. When Copilot coding agent finishes its work, it updates the body of its pull request with a summary of changes. Now, Copilot can follow the repository’s pull request template when writing the body.
