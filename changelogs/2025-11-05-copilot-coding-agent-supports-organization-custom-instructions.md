# Copilot coding agent supports organization custom instructions

## Overview
Copilot coding agent , our asynchronous, autonomous background agent, now supports organization custom instructions.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- Copilot coding agent , our asynchronous, autonomous background agent, now supports organization custom instructions.
- Custom instructions allow you to guide Copilot on how to understand your project as well as how to build, test, and validate its changes. Now, you can also set default instructions for all coding agent usage across your organization, ensuring a consistent experience across teams.
- Alongside organization custom instructions, coding agent continues to support .github/copilot-instructions.md , .github/instructions/**.instructions.md , AGENTS.md , CLAUDE.md , and GEMINI.md files.
