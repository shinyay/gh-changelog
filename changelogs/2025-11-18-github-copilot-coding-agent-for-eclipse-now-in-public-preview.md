## Overview
GitHub Copilot coding agent is now available in public preview for Eclipse. This release brings Copilot directly into native Eclipse workflows.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview

### What’s new
- Delegate from Eclipse : Describe a task in Copilot Chat and hand it off to the agent without leaving Eclipse; Copilot will execute the work in GitHub’s managed cloud environment, open a draft pull request, and queue up a review when finished.
- Inline job tracking : A job card will appear in Copilot Chat with live status, links to the draft pull request, and quick actions to cancel or resume work. The new GitHub Coding Agent Jobs view in the sidebar will keep your active and past tasks in one place.

### Try it out
- To get started with coding agent in Eclipse:
- Prerequisites : Make sure you have a GitHub Copilot license and write access to your repository.
- Open Copilot Chat : Access the Copilot Chat tool window in Eclipse. In the chat window, you’ll see mode options, such as Agent and Ask at the top (usually as tabs or a dropdown).
- Assign a task : Describe the task in the chat box, then click the Delegate to coding agent button to start the coding agent.
- Track progress : After assignment, a job card appears in Copilot Chat. Open it on GitHub (web) or track it inside the IDE. In the IDE, use built-in GitHub pull request tools to view diffs, status, or cancel the session. Get notifications for status changes (finished, error, etc.)
