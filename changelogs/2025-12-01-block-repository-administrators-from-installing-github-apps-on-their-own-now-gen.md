# Block repository administrators from installing GitHub Apps on their own now generally available

## Overview
Organization owners can now better control which users are allowed to install GitHub Apps across their repositories with a new setting.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- Organization owners can now better control which users are allowed to install GitHub Apps across their repositories with a new setting.
- Previously, any user with admin permissions on a repository—including outside collaborators—could install GitHub Apps that requested only repository-level permissions. This could cause unexpected app installations and governance challenges, particularly for organizations with strict security or compliance requirements.
- With this new setting, organization owners can prevent repository admins from installing GitHub Apps on the repositories they manage. When the setting is enabled, only organization owners will be able to install GitHub Apps on organization repositories. Repository admins must instead request an app installation from an organization owner.
- How this benefits you
- Strengthen governance for your organization by ensuring only trusted users can install GitHub Apps across repositories.
- Reduce the risk of unauthorized or unexpected app installations.
