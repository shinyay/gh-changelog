# Copilot Spaces: Public spaces and code view support

## Overview
We released three major updates to Copilot Spaces: public spaces, individual sharing, and the ability to add files to a space directly from the github.com code viewer.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- We released three major updates to Copilot Spaces: public spaces, individual sharing, and the ability to add files to a space directly from the github.com code viewer.

### Public spaces
- You can now make any space publicly accessible to anyone with the link. This is perfect for:
- Open-source documentation and resources.
- Sharing templates and workflows with the GitHub community.
- Cross-organization collaboration.
- Educational demos.
- Public spaces are only available for individual-owned spaces, not organization-owned spaces. They are view-only by default to protect content integrity. We’ve added individual sharing to add more access controls.

### Individual sharing
- Individual-owned spaces can now be shared. This unlocks lightweight personal workflows and flexible collaboration across individuals.

### Privacy & security
- This release maintains GitHub’s security and trust standards:
- No private or sensitive content is ever exposed. Public spaces and individual sharing only surface content the viewer already has permission to see.
- Role-based access control is always enforced , even on public spaces.
- Access changes take effect immediately , ensuring full control at all times.
- Public links do not require sign-in , but viewers only see what they’re already authorized to access.
- Public spaces are discoverable only via direct link. They are not indexed.

### 📎 Add files to a space directly from the code viewer
- You can now add files to a space right from the github.com code viewer. This embedded entry point fits into your natural workflows and reduces context switching.

### Security & permissions
- Users can only add files they have permission to access.
- Space-level role-based access control and repository access controls continue to apply.
