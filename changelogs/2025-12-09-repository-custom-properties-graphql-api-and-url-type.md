### Manage custom properties via GraphQL
- You can now manage custom repository properties using the GraphQL API. This gives you programmatic access to create, update, and delete custom properties with your existing workflows and automation tools.
- To learn more, see the GraphQL API documentation for custom properties . Note: there is a delay in publishing GraphQL documentation and may take 24 hours to go live.

### New URL property type
- Custom repository properties now support a URL type with built-in validation. This makes it easier for admins to attach relevant resources to repositories like runbooks, monitoring dashboards, or external documentation without worrying about invalid URLs.
- When you create a URL property, GitHub automatically validates that values are properly formatted URLs, ensuring consistency across your organization.

### [Manage custom properties via GraphQL](#manage-custom-properties-via-graphql)


You can now manage custom repository properties using the GraphQL API. This gives you programmatic access to create, update, and delete custom properties with your existing workflows and automation tools.


To learn more, see [the GraphQL API documentation for custom properties](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference). **Note:** there is a delay in publishing GraphQL documentation and may take 24 hours to go live.


### [New URL property type](#new-url-property-type)


![The GitHub "New property" interface showing the configuration for a custom property named "AzureK8Fleet" with the type set to URL. The form includes a default value linking directly to the Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Fleet portal.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb05d0b9-2093-4cc5-8d1e-f761bb75da5a)


Custom repository properties now support a `URL` type with built\-in validation. This makes it easier for admins to attach relevant resources to repositories like runbooks, monitoring dashboards, or external documentation without worrying about invalid URLs.


When you create a `URL` property, GitHub automatically validates that values are properly formatted URLs, ensuring consistency across your organization.
