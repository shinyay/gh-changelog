# Agentic memory for GitHub Copilot is in public preview

## Overview
Copilot memory is now available in public preview for all paid GitHub Copilot plans.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- Copilot memory is now available in public preview for all paid GitHub Copilot plans.
- Copilot memory enables Copilot to learn and retain useful details about your repositories. As you work with Copilot coding agent, Copilot code review, or Copilot CLI, it builds a repository-specific understanding that improves the quality of its assistance over time.

### How it works
- Copilot automatically captures tightly scoped insights called “memories” as it works in your repositories. These memories are:
- Repository-specific and validated against the current codebase before use.
- Shared across Copilot features, so what coding agent learns can help code review.
- Automatically expired after 28 days to prevent stale information.
- For more details on how exactly Copilot memory works, check out our engineering blog post on Copilot memory .

### Get started
- Individual users (Copilot Pro or Pro+): Enable Copilot memory in your personal Copilot settings .
- Organizations and enterprises : Enable through policy settings in your organization or enterprise settings.
- Repository owners can review and delete stored memories in Repository Settings > Copilot > Memory .
- To learn more about how to use this feature, check out our Copilot memory documentation .
- Join the discussion within GitHub Community .

## Impact / Who’s Affected

Copilot memory enables Copilot to learn and retain useful details about your repositories. As you work with Copilot coding agent, Copilot code review, or Copilot CLI, it builds a repository\-specific understanding that improves the quality of its assistance over time.


### [How it works](#how-it-works)


Copilot automatically captures tightly scoped insights called “memories” as it works in your repositories. These memories are:


* Repository\-specific and validated against the current codebase before use.
* Shared across Copilot features, so what coding agent learns can help code review.
* Automatically expired after 28 days to prevent stale information.

### [Get started](#get-started)


* **Individual users** (Copilot Pro or Pro\+): Enable Copilot memory in your [personal Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).
* **Organizations and enterprises**: Enable through policy settings in your organization or enterprise settings.


Repository owners can review and delete stored memories in **Repository Settings \> Copilot \> Memory**.
