# Pinned comments on GitHub Issues

## Overview
We’ve shipped two updates to GitHub Issues that make them easier to scan and help reduce noise.

## Detailed Explanation
### Overview
- We’ve shipped two updates to GitHub Issues that make them easier to scan and help reduce noise.

### Pin a comment on an issue
- You can now pin a comment to the top of an issue from the comment ... menu. Pinned comments make it easy to surface key updates, decisions, or next steps, so anyone viewing the issue can quickly understand what matters most.

### Fewer low-quality comments
- To help keep issues focused, we’ve added a small nudge that encourages people to react and subscribe instead of leaving comments like “+1” or “same here.” This reduces noise, clutter, and unnecessary notifications, while still giving an easy way to show support and stay updated.
