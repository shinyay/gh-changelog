        "By adding a configuration file under .github/agents in any repository or in the agents folder in the {org}/.github or {org}/.github-private repository, you can define agent personas that capture your team’s workflows, conventions, and unique needs. These agents can be further tailored with prompts, tool selections, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to optimize for specific use cases.",
        "Anyone using GitHub Copilot can define and use custom agents, whether you’re an individual developer, part of a team, or managing an organization. Custom agents work across Copilot coding agent in github.com, the Copilot CLI, and will be coming to a future release of Visual Studio Code."
