        "For example, leaked OpenAI keys will display the secret owner’s name, email, and identifier, in addition to information about the organization when available. These new metadata keys expand on existing validity checks to give more actionable context for triage and remediation, enabling development and security teams to assess exposure faster and prioritize remediation.",
        "Please note, metadata availability will vary by secret provider, token type, and possibly even for a specific secret at different points in time. GitHub makes a best effort to display metadata for the secret, but not all metadata keys may be available for a secret."
