        "At Universe 2025, we announced the public preview of the agent control plane . This is a suite of governance features designed to give enterprises deeper control over and greater ability to audit the use of Copilot features, custom agents, and MCP configurations across their business.",

        "Note : The above FGPs do not grant access to the deep links in the AI Controls tab like access management, audit logs, or rulesets, unless the corresponding FGPs that control those enterprise views are also added to the custom role. For example, Enterprise owners need to explicitly add the Read enterprise audit logs FGP to allow the custom role to view audit log events for your enterprise. This helps AI managers monitor agentic activity.",
        "An enterprise role with the above FGPs can then be assigned to individual members or to an enterprise team to enable AI management at scale.",
