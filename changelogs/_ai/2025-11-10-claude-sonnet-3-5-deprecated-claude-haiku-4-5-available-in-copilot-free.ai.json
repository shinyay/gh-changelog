        "As part of this change, Claude Haiku 4.5—a significantly stronger model with enhanced coding capabilities—will be available to all Copilot users, including Copilot Free. This ensures continued access to Anthropic’s advanced technology at no cost.",
        "Please update your workflows and integrations to use supported models. Copilot Enterprise administrators may need to enable access to alternative models through their model policies in Copilot settings. As an administrator, you can verify availability by checking your individual Copilot settings and confirming that the policy is enabled for the specific model. Once enabled, you’ll see the model in the Copilot Chat model selector in VS Code and on github.com. No action is required to remove the deprecated models.",
