        "This enhancement enables fine-grained, attribute-based access control and improves auditability for workflows that integrate with external services. Platform teams often need to correlate an OIDC token back to the specific job and compute that generated it for compliance and traceability. For example, when workflows call internal services hosted on Azure, teams need to link the token to the job run for auditing. Previously, the token lacked a way to identify the exact job. With check_run_id alongside existing claims like run_id and run_attempt , you can now:",
