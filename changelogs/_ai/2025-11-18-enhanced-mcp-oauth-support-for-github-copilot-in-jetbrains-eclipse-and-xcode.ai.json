        "MCP first attempts a Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) handshake for automatic client setup. If the IdP does not support DCR, Copilot falls back to a client-credentials workflow, allowing you to manually configure static client IDs and secrets. These improvements give developers greater flexibility to integrate enterprise IdPs or custom identity services while maintaining security and compliance."
