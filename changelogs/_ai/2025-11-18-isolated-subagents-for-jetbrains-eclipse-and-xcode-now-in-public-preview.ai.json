  "overview": "We’re excited to share that isolated subagents are now in public preview across JetBrains IDEs, Eclipse, and Xcode! Empowered by isolated context, subagents let you delegate focused tasks to autonomous copilots without leaving your current chat session, so you can keep momentum while Copilot researches, designs APIs, reviews code, or gathers project context on your behalf. Each subagent operates within its own isolated context, ensuring your main conversation stays clean and focused.",
