        "Artifacts built through GitHub Actions can now appear in GitHub as “linked artifacts,” even when they’re ultimately stored in external registries such as Azure Container Registry or JFrog Artifactory. For each linked artifact, GitHub shows new metadata: you’ll see what repository built the artifact, which package registry the artifact is stored in, and where it’s been deployed. All attested artifacts are automatically mapped to their source code repositories, so you can trace every artifact back to its origin. This is powered by new Artifact Metadata APIs for storage and deployment records, so your CI/CD workflows or external systems can programmatically send data to GitHub, keeping the linked view up to date."

This context is natively supplied by Microsoft Defender for Cloud, which includes a native implementation of the Deployment Record API to automatically populate deployment records and runtime risk attributes without requiring workflow changes. This gives both security and development teams shared visibility into how build artifacts are being used and the types of real-world risks they may pose once deployed."
