        "Language and framework support",
        "Swift : CodeQL now supports Swift 6.2, ensuring you can analyze projects built with this version.",
        "Rust : We’ve added support for the actix-web web framework and extended support for the mysql and mysql_async libraries.",
        "C# : We’ve added tracer support for macOS and Linux when the .NET CLI ( dotnet ) directly invokes the C# compiler ( csc ), providing basic tracing and extraction capabilities for .NET 10 RC2 on these platforms.",
        "Query changes",
        "C#",
        "We’ve completely rewritten the cs/dereferenced-value-may-be-null query, which removes a very significant number of false positives. This query has also been changed from a path-problem query to a problem query, so paths are no longer reported.",
        "We’ve updated the cs/constant-condition query to report a wider range of high confidence results.",
        "We’ve improved the cs/web/missing-x-frame-options query, so it now correctly handles configuration nested in root “ elements.",
        "Java/Kotlin",
        "We’ve promoted the java/sensitive-cookie-not-httponly query from experimental to the main query pack."
