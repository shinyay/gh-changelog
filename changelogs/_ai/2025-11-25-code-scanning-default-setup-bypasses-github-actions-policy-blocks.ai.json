In the past, restrictive actions policies could block code scanning default setup from running and reduce your security coverage. With this update, you can limit which GitHub Actions workflows run (e.g., allowing only enterprise-approved workflows), but the code scanning default setup workflow will still run as long as GitHub Actions is enabled.",
