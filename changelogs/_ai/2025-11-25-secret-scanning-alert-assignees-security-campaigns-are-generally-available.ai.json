If that user didn’t have access to view the alert at the time they were assigned, they’ll receive permissions to view and edit the alert. If they received permissions by being assigned to the alert, they’ll lose permissions if they are unassigned. Secret scanning alert assignees will be available for GitHub Enterprise Server customers starting with version 3.20.",
