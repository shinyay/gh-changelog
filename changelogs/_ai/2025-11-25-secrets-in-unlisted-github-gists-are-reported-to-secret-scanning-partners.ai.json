        "GitHub works directly with industry partners like AWS, OpenAI, and Stripe to build detectors for their specific secret formats, ensuring high accuracy and a low number of false positives. GitHub notifies the secret issuer when publicly leaked secrets are found, allowing the partner to take immediate action. For repositories where secret scanning is enabled, GitHub will also notify the developer with a secret scanning alert."

      "bullets": [
        "Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets with others. If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account, and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your gist home page.",
        "Gists can be public or secret. Public gists show up in Discover, where people can browse new gists as they’re created. They’re also searchable, so you can use them if you’d like other people to find and see your work. Secret gists don’t show up in Discover and are not searchable unless you are logged in and are the author of the secret gist. Secret gists aren’t private; if you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they’ll be able to see it. However, if someone you don’t know discovers the URL, they’ll also be able to see your gist. If you need to keep your code away from prying eyes, you may want to create a private repository instead.",
