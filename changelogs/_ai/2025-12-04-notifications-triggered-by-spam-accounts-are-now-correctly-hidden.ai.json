Previously, notifications triggered by spammy activity could remain visible and contribute to your unread repository counters, even after hiding or flagging them. This led to confusion and unnecessary clutter in the notification experience.",
        "Now, once an account or repository is marked as spam, notifications they triggered will no longer show up in sidebar counters or counts, even if you were mentioned by them before the spam was detected. As part of this change, close to 6 million spam-related notifications were cleaned up across GitHub to help keep your notifications clear and actionable."
