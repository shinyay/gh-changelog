        "Since Go resolves dependency versions dynamically, getting an accurate picture of a project’s dependencies cannot rely on static parsing. Now, when a commit updates a project’s go.mod , GitHub runs a new type of Dependabot job that builds a dependency snapshot and uploads it to the Dependency Submission API.",
        "This approach is similar to dependency autosubmission for other ecosystems, but it will not incur charges for actions minutes. It can also access organization-wide configurations for private registries you’ve set up for Dependabot.",
