These sessions automatically expire after two hours, requiring reauthentication to continue publishing. Unlike traditional tokens, session tokens won’t appear in your UI or CLI token lists—they work behind the scenes to maintain your authenticated session. During these sessions, 2FA is enforced for publishing operations, adding an extra layer of security."

        "For CI/CD workflows, create granular access tokens using the new CLI commands ( npm token create ) or at npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens . When setting up these tokens, you may enable Bypass 2FA for noninteractive automated workflows and set appropriate expiration (write tokens limited to 90 days maximum). For the most secure deployment, consider adopting OIDC trusted publishing , which eliminates the need to generate and manage tokens for publishing packages."
