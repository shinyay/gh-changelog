        "Zero in with filtering: Refine your search using filters like visibility , language , organization , and more. Sort by relevance to surface the repositories where you’re most active.",

        "You can filter by repository custom properties by preceding the property with an organization name and manually typing the property and value. We’re working to add automatic suggestions for properties and values in a future update. Sample query: org:Byte-Sized-Demo props.production:true",
