        "Bazel uses two dependency systems, both the modern Bzlmod system ( MODULE.bazel files) and the legacy WORKSPACE system. Community feedback showed many teams still rely on WORKSPACE, so we built support for both. Additionally, Bazel’s MODULE.bazel.lock files capture complex transitive dependency graphs, including module extensions and repository rules. Incorrect lockfile generation breaks reproducible builds, so we worked closely with the Bazel community to get this right."
