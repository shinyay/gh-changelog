        "We are continuing to reduce hosted-runners prices by up to 39% on January 1, 2026.",
        "We have real costs in running the Actions control plane. We are also making investments into self-hosted runners so they work at scale in customer environments, particularly for complex enterprise scenarios. While this context matters, we missed the mark with this change by not including more of you in our planning.",
        "We need to improve GitHub Actions. We’re taking more time to meet and listen closely to developers, customers, and partners to start. We’ve also opened a discussion to collect more direct feedback and will use that feedback to inform the GitHub Actions roadmap. We’re working hard to earn your trust through consistent delivery across GitHub Actions and the entire platform."

      "bullets": [
        "Why am I being charged to use my own hardware? Historically, self-hosted runner customers were able to leverage much of GitHub Actions’ infrastructure and services at no cost. This meant that the cost of maintaining and evolving these essential services was largely being subsidized by the prices set for GitHub-hosted runners. By updating our pricing, we’re aligning costs more closely with usage and the value delivered to every Actions user,  while fueling further innovation and investment across the platform. The vast majority of users, especially individuals and small teams, will see no price increase.",
        "You can see the Actions pricing calculator to estimate your future costs.",
        "What are the new GitHub-hosted runner rates? See the GitHub Actions runner pricing reference for the updated rates that will go into effect on January 1, 2026. These listed rates include the new $0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform charge.",
        "Why is .002/minute the right price for self-hosted runners on cloud? We determined per-minute was deemed the most fair and accurate by our users, and compared to other self-hosted CI solutions in the market. We believe this is a sustainable option that will not deeply impact our lightly- nor heavily-active customers, while still delivering fast, flexible workloads for the best end user experience.",
        "Which job execution scenarios for GitHub Actions are affected by this pricing change?",
        "Jobs that run in private repositories and use standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners",
        "Any jobs running on larger GitHub-hosted runners",
        "Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free. GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted by this change.",
        "When will this pricing change take effect?",
        "The price decrease for GitHub-hosted runners will take effect on January 1, 2026. The new charge for self-hosted runners will apply beginning on March 1, 2026. The price changes will impact all customers on these dates.",
        "Will the free usage quota available in my plan change? Beginning March 1, 2026, self-hosted runners will be included within your free usage quota, and will consume available usage based on list price the same way that Linux, Windows, and MacOS standard runners work today.",
        "Will self-hosted runner usage consume from my free usage minutes? Yes, billable self-hosted runner usage will be able to consume minutes from the free quota associated with your plan."
