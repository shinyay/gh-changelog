        "Extended metadata checks are a nested feature under validity checks. If you’ve already enabled validity checks for your repositories via security configurations, you’ll automatically have extended metadata checks enabled."

      "bullets": [
        "With extended metadata checks, secret scanning alerts now display details about a secret’s owner, secret creation and expiry dates, and project or organization context when information is available from the secret provider. This feature extends validity checks to additional context about the secret.",
        "For example, leaked OpenAI keys with information available will display the secret owner’s name, email, and identifier, in addition to information about the organization.",
        "These new metadata keys expand on existing validity checks to give more actionable context for triage and remediation, enabling development and security teams to assess exposure faster and prioritize remediation.",
        "Note: The availability of metadata depends on the secret provider, the type of token, and sometimes even the secret itself. GitHub makes a best effort to display all available metadata, but not every key will always be present."

Starting on this date, users will be able to enable or disable the feature at organization and enterprise levels with security configurations.
