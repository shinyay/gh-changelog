        "The experience is conversational. Copilot uses the new ask_user tool to prompt you with follow-up questions, confirm assumptions about feature scope, and get your input on design decisions. Once you’re aligned on the approach, you can review the plan in a dedicated panel and tell Copilot to start implementing.",

Send follow-up messages to steer the conversation in a different direction, or queue additional instructions for Copilot to process after it finishes its current response. This makes conversations feel more natural and keeps you in control.",
        "Inline feedback on rejection: When you reject a tool permission request, you can give Copilot inline feedback about the rejection so it can adapt its approach without stopping entirely. This makes the conversation flow more naturally when you want to guide Copilot away from certain actions."
