        "Removes static, long-lived credentials from repository secrets.",

  ],
  "key_changes": [
    "Dependabot added OIDC-based authentication support for certain private registries.",
    "Dependabot update jobs can obtain short-lived credentials dynamically instead of relying on long-lived stored secrets.",
    "Supported registry targets include AWS CodeArtifact, Azure DevOps Artifacts, and JFrog Artifactory."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Repositories using Dependabot with private registries can reduce secret sprawl by eliminating long-lived registry credentials stored as repository secrets.",
    "Teams must update `dependabot.yml` to opt into the OIDC authentication type.",
    "Security and compliance teams may benefit from a more auditable, policy-aligned authentication approach consistent with existing OIDC federation usage."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "Support for registries beyond the three listed is Not stated in the article.",
    "Exact configuration syntax and identity provider prerequisites are not included in the announcement (the article links to documentation).",
    "Availability constraints (plans, rollout, regions) are Not stated in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The messaging focuses on reducing long-lived secrets and operational burden, signaling security posture as the primary driver.",
    "Calling out rate limiting suggests this may also address reliability issues tied to static token usage.",
    "Aligning Dependabot auth with GitHub Actions OIDC federation patterns implies a broader strategy of standardizing cloud identity integrations."
