        "Dependabot update jobs can use OIDC to authenticate to private registries.",

        "Eliminates static, long-lived credentials stored in repositories.",

        "Update `dependabot.yml` to use the new OIDC authentication type for supported registries.",

  ],
  "key_changes": [
    "Added OIDC-based authentication for Dependabot when accessing supported private registries.",
    "Dependabot can obtain short-lived credentials dynamically instead of using long-lived secrets.",
    "Supported registries include AWS CodeArtifact, Azure DevOps Artifacts, and JFrog Artifactory."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Repositories using Dependabot with private registries can reduce or remove long-lived registry credentials stored as repository secrets.",
    "Teams must update `dependabot.yml` to opt into the new OIDC authentication type for supported registries.",
    "Security/compliance stakeholders may benefit from a reduced secret-management footprint, but should review the documentation for required identity provider configuration."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "Support for registries beyond AWS CodeArtifact, Azure DevOps Artifacts, and JFrog Artifactory is Not stated in the article.",
    "Exact `dependabot.yml` syntax and step-by-step setup instructions are Not stated in the article (the announcement links to documentation).",
    "Prerequisites and rollout limitations (availability, plans, regions) are Not stated in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The change is framed primarily as a security improvement (removing long-lived secrets) rather than a feature expansion for new ecosystems.",
    "By explicitly comparing to GitHub Actions OIDC federation, the article suggests aligning Dependabot authentication with existing identity-provider trust patterns.",
    "The mention of rate limiting indicates this may also address operational pain from static token usage, not just secret hygiene."
