        "A standalone Go-based module that enables custom autoscaling without requiring Kubernetes.",
        "Platform agnostic: supports containers, VMs, bare metal across Windows, Linux, and macOS.",
        "Provides full provisioning control and multi-label support.",
        "Supports agentic scenarios including Copilot coding agent workloads.",
        "Includes real-time telemetry for monitoring runner operations.",
        "Not intended as a replacement for ARC (Actions Runner Controller).",

      "bullets": [
        "Action allowlisting is now available across all GitHub plan types: Free, Team, and Enterprise.",

  "key_changes": [
    "Runner Scale Set Client released in public preview as a standalone Go-based module for custom autoscaling without Kubernetes.",
    "Action allowlisting expanded from Enterprise-only to all plan types (Free, Team, Enterprise).",
    "New windows-2025-vs2026 runner image in public preview; VS 2026 will merge into windows-2025 at GA on May 4, 2026.",
    "macOS 26 Intel image (macos-26-large) available in public preview for larger runners."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Teams running self-hosted infrastructure outside Kubernetes can now leverage GitHub’s autoscaling with the Runner Scale Set Client.",
    "Organizations on Free and Team plans gain action allowlisting controls previously exclusive to Enterprise.",
    "CI/CD pipelines targeting Visual Studio 2026 can begin testing with the new windows-2025-vs2026 image.",
    "Larger runner users on Intel-based macOS workflows can adopt macOS 26."

  "caveats": [
    "The Runner Scale Set Client is in public preview and is not a replacement for ARC.",
    "ARC multi-label support arrives separately in v0.14.0, scheduled for March 2026.",
    "The windows-2025-vs2026 image is in preview; VS 2026 integration into windows-2025 is planned for GA on May 4, 2026.",
    "macOS 26 Intel is limited to larger runners and is in public preview."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "Offering a Go-based standalone client decouples GitHub’s autoscaling from Kubernetes, addressing a major friction point for enterprises that run non-Kubernetes infrastructure.",
    "Expanding action allowlisting to Free and Team plans signals GitHub is democratizing security controls across all tiers.",
    "The agentic scenario support in the Runner Scale Set Client reflects growing investment in AI-driven developer workflows like Copilot coding agent."
