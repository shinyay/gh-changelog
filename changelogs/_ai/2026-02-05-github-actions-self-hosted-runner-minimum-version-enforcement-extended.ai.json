    "Minimum version enforcement deadline extended by one week to March 16, 2026.",
    "Brownout period: February 16 – March 16, with escalating configuration blocks.",
    "Full enforcement begins March 16, 2026: runners below v2.329.0 permanently blocked.",
    "Minimum required version is v2.329.0 (released October 15, 2025)."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "All organizations using self-hosted runners must ensure runners are at v2.329.0 or later by March 16, 2026.",
    "CI/CD pipelines using older runner versions will experience temporary blocks during the brownout period.",
    "Teams with runner images baked into templates or automation need to rebuild with the updated version."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "The one-week extension is the only change; the minimum version requirement (v2.329.0) remains the same.",
    "Brownout blocks are scheduled and will affect runners below the minimum version even before full enforcement.",
    "After March 16, older runners cannot self-upgrade via the configuration script; they must be manually updated first."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The extension suggests that a significant number of organizations had not yet upgraded, prompting GitHub to provide additional time.",
    "The escalating brownout schedule is designed to create urgency progressively, giving teams early warning signals.",
    "Organizations should treat the brownout blocks as dry runs to identify all runners that still need upgrading."
