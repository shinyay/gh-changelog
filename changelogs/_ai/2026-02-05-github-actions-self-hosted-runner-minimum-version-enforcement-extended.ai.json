  "overview": "GitHub has extended the self-hosted runner minimum version enforcement deadline by one week to March 16, 2026. Runners below v2.329.0 will be permanently blocked after that date, with brownout periods starting February 16 to encourage timely upgrades.",

  "key_changes": [
    "Enforcement deadline extended by one week to March 16, 2026.",
    "Minimum required version is v2.329.0 (released October 15, 2025).",
    "Brownout periods begin February 16 with escalating blocks: 1-hour (week 1), multi-hour (weeks 2–3), continuous (from March 9).",
    "After March 16, runners below v2.329.0 are permanently blocked and cannot self-upgrade."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "All organizations using self-hosted runners must upgrade to v2.329.0+ before March 16, 2026 or lose CI/CD capability on those runners.",
    "Brownout periods starting February 16 will cause intermittent job failures for non-compliant runners, serving as early warnings.",
    "Teams relying on custom runner images need to rebuild with the updated runner binary.",
    "Automation and provisioning scripts referencing older runner versions must be updated."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "Runners below v2.329.0 cannot self-upgrade once blocked; manual download and deployment is required.",
    "The one-week extension is the final extension mentioned; no further extensions are indicated.",
    "Brownout disruptions begin February 16, well before the hard cutoff."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The escalating brownout strategy (1-hour → multi-hour → continuous) is designed to give teams progressive urgency signals rather than an abrupt cutoff.",
    "Extending the deadline by only one week suggests GitHub considers most organizations should already be prepared from the December 2025 notice.",
    "The inability to self-upgrade after the cutoff is a deliberate forcing function to ensure organizations maintain runner infrastructure actively."
