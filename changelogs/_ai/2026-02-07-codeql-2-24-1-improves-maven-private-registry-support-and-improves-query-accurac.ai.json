  "overview": "CodeQL 2.24.1 expands language and framework support — including Kotlin up to 2.3.0, Struts 7.x, Maven private registries as plugin repositories, C23/C++26 #embed, C# 14 null-conditional assignments, and new Python taint sources for agents/openai/websockets — while improving query accuracy with reduced false positives and adding an experimental Python prompt injection query.",

        "C23/C++26 #embed directive support added.",
        "C# 14 null-conditional assignment support added.",
        "Python ListElement path and taint tracking added for agents and openai modules.",

        "Improved buffer size accuracy reduces false positives across 6 buffer overflow queries.",
        "Java java/unreleased-lock query improved for better detection.",

  "key_changes": [
    "Kotlin support extended to 2.3.0; versions 1.6.x and 1.7.x dropped.",
    "Struts 7.x support and Maven private registry plugin repository support for Default Setup.",
    "C23/C++26 #embed and C# 14 null-conditional assignment support.",
    "Python taint tracking for agents/openai modules and websockets remote flow sources.",
    "Reduced false positives in 6 C/C++ buffer overflow queries via improved buffer size accuracy.",

  "impact": [
    "Teams using Kotlin 2.x get updated analysis up to 2.3.0; those on 1.6.x/1.7.x must upgrade.",
    "Java projects using Maven private registries benefit from Default Setup compatibility for plugin resolution.",
    "Python developers building AI/LLM applications gain taint tracking for openai/agents modules and a new prompt injection detection query.",
    "C/C++ codebases will see fewer false positive buffer overflow alerts.",
    "GitHub.com users receive these improvements automatically; GHES users must wait for a future release."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "Kotlin 1.6.x and 1.7.x are no longer supported; projects on these versions must upgrade.",
    "The py/prompt-injection query is experimental and may produce false positives or miss some patterns.",
    "GHES users do not receive these changes until a future GHES release.",
    "The specific GHES release version for these changes is not stated in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The new py/prompt-injection query signals GitHub’s recognition of LLM prompt injection as a supply-chain-level security concern worth detecting statically.",
    "Adding taint tracking for the openai and agents Python modules shows CodeQL is actively following the AI-agent development ecosystem.",
    "Dropping Kotlin 1.6.x/1.7.x while adding 2.3.0 support indicates CodeQL is prioritizing modern language versions and reducing maintenance burden for legacy versions."
