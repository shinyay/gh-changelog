  "key_changes": [
    "Maven private registries now double as plugin repositories when configured for Default Setup.",
    "Kotlin analysis support extended to 2.3.0; Kotlin 1.6.x/1.7.x dropped.",
    "C23/C++26 #embed preprocessor directive support added.",
    "C# 14 null-conditional assignment support added.",
    "Python taint models added for openai and agents modules; remote flow sources for websockets.",
    "New experimental py/prompt-injection query for detecting LLM prompt injection vulnerabilities.",
    "Six C/C++ buffer overflow queries produce fewer false positives.",
    "GitHub Actions analysis crash on long expressions fixed."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Java teams using Maven private registries with Default Setup gain automatic plugin repository configuration.",
    "Kotlin teams must be on 1.8.x or later as 1.6.x/1.7.x support is removed.",
    "C/C++ codebases will see fewer false positive alerts for buffer overflow queries.",
    "Python developers using OpenAI/agents libraries benefit from improved taint tracking for security analysis.",
    "Teams building LLM-powered applications can detect prompt injection risks with the new experimental query.",
    "GHES users need to manually upgrade CodeQL or wait for the next GHES release to get these improvements."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "The py/prompt-injection query is experimental and may produce false positives or miss some patterns.",
    "Kotlin 1.6.x and 1.7.x are no longer supported — projects using these versions must upgrade.",
    "GHES users do not receive the update automatically and must either wait for a GHES release or manually upgrade.",
    "The exact GHES release version that will include CodeQL 2.24.1 is not stated in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The addition of taint models for openai and agents modules reflects the growing importance of AI/LLM security in code scanning.",
    "The experimental py/prompt-injection query positions CodeQL as a tool for securing AI-powered applications.",
    "Maven plugin repository support for private registries addresses a common pain point in enterprise Java environments.",
    "The continued expansion of language version support (Kotlin 2.3.0, C# 14, C23/C++26) keeps CodeQL aligned with modern language evolution."
