    {
      "title": "What is Fast mode",
      "bullets": [
        "A research preview variant of Claude Opus 4.6 optimized for speed.",
        "Delivers up to 2.5x faster output token generation.",
        "Maintains the same intelligence and capability as the standard Opus 4.6 model.",
        "Described as early and experimental."

      "title": "Availability",
      "bullets": [
        "Available to Copilot Enterprise users only during the preview.",
        "Selectable via the model picker in VS Code (chat, ask, edit, agent modes) and Copilot CLI.",
        "Rollout is gradual; the model may not be immediately visible to all users."
      ]

    {
      "title": "Enablement requirements",
      "bullets": [
        "Enterprise plan administrators must enable the 'Fast mode for Claude Opus 4.6' policy in Copilot settings.",
        "The policy is not enabled by default during the preview period."

  "key_changes": [
    "Fast mode for Claude Opus 4.6 introduced as a research preview with up to 2.5x faster output tokens.",
    "Available in VS Code model picker (chat, ask, edit, agent) and Copilot CLI.",
    "Enterprise admins must explicitly enable the Fast mode policy in Copilot settings."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Copilot Enterprise users can opt into significantly faster Claude Opus 4.6 responses for iterative coding tasks.",
    "Enterprise admins gain a new policy toggle to control access to the Fast mode variant.",
    "Developers using Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Free plans do not have access during this preview."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "The feature is in research preview and described as early and experimental.",
    "Only available to Copilot Enterprise users; other plan tiers are not included.",
    "Rollout is gradual and may not be immediately visible.",
    "Pricing or premium request consumption details for Fast mode are Not stated in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The 'research preview' label and 'early and experimental' language suggest this is an early-stage optimization that may evolve before broader availability.",
    "Restricting to Enterprise users only indicates a cautious rollout, likely gathering usage data before expanding to other plan tiers.",
    "The 2.5x speed improvement targets the latency bottleneck that is particularly noticeable in agentic workflows requiring many iterative model calls."
