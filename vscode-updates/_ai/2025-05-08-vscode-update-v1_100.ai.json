  "overview": "VS Code 1.100 focuses on making Copilot Chat more configurable and reusable (prompt files and instructions files), improving agent/edit performance, and expanding Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities. It also adds notable UX improvements such as floating window modes and strengthens extension security with mandatory signature verification on Linux (with a noted ARM32 exception).",

        "Introduces aligned concepts for Markdown-based instructions files (.instructions.md) and standalone prompt files (.prompt.md).",
        "Instructions files provide reusable guidance/context and can be attached manually or auto-applied via an applyTo glob in front matter.",
        "Prompt files capture a complete request (mode, tools) and can be run via slash command in chat, the editor Play button, or a command palette action.",
        "Adds language IDs for Prompt/Instructions files and supports a description header for friendlier summaries."

  "impact": [
    "Teams standardizing Copilot usage can encode workflow rules as instructions files and reusable prompts as prompt files.",
    "Users relying on agent mode should see faster iteration loops and better handling of errors introduced by edits.",
    "Developers exploring code outside their workspace can query remote repos via #githubRepo.",
    "Organizations and Linux users benefit from stronger extension integrity enforcement, reducing malicious extension risk.",
    "Users working with MCP servers gain new transport support and improved interaction feedback."

  "insights": [
    "The release puts strong emphasis on making AI assistance reproducible and shareable (prompts/instructions) rather than purely ad-hoc chat.",
    "A recurring theme is reducing friction in agent workflows: faster edits, better error recovery, and prompt-caching optimizations.",
    "MCP capabilities are treated as a first-class extension point, with transport and UX polish landing alongside core chat features."
