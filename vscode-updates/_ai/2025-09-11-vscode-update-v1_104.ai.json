  "overview": "VS Code 1.104 focuses on safer and more flexible agent workflows: auto model selection (preview), confirmation for edits to sensitive files, AGENTS.md-based instructions, and an improved changed-files experience in agent mode. It also revises terminal auto-approve UX and settings, enables math rendering by default, and adds improvements to semantic search and AI feature controls.",

  "impact": [
    "Organizations can improve safety posture for agent edits by requiring confirmation for sensitive file patterns.",
    "Teams using multiple AI agents can centralize agent guidance via AGENTS.md and have it applied automatically.",
    "Users can reduce cognitive load during agent sessions with a more compact changed-files list and automatic acceptance when staging/committing.",
    "Copilot users gain simpler model choice via Auto and more transparent per-response model/multiplier visibility.",
    "Developers who prefer non-AI workflows can disable AI features via a single setting."

  "caveats": [
    "Auto model selection is described as preview and is rolling out over weeks; exact rollout timing and eligibility details beyond what is stated are not provided in the article.",
    "AGENTS.md support is described as experimental and controlled by a setting.",
    "The set of default terminal auto-approve rules is referenced as viewable in settings.json; the full list is not enumerated in the article text."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The release prioritizes ‘safe autonomy’: enabling agents to do more while adding guardrails (sensitive file confirmation, clearer auto-approve).",
    "There is a clear shift toward team-scale AI workflows, with AGENTS.md and prompt-mode improvements aimed at standardization.",
    "Operational transparency is emphasized (model/multiplier visibility, warnings for internet downloads, skip tool calls)."
