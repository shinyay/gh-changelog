  "overview": "VS Code 1.106 (October 2025) centers on an 'Agent HQ' experience for managing sessions, plus security/trust improvements and editor UX upgrades. It also continues the open-source AI editor effort by open-sourcing inline suggestions and consolidating Copilot extension functionality.",

        "Adds search in the sessions list (`kb(list.find)`) to find sessions.",
        "Introduces a Plan agent that asks clarifying questions and generates a plan that you approve before implementation.",

  "impact": [
    "Anyone delegating work to agents: gets a central sessions hub and a clearer plan→implement workflow.",
    "Extension authors and teams customizing agent behavior: need to adopt the new custom agent file conventions and metadata.",
    "Developers reviewing diffs: can copy deleted lines and navigate multi-file diffs more efficiently.",
    "Enterprise/Linux administrators: can enforce policies using JSON on Linux."

  "caveats": [
    "Some parts of the consolidated Agent Sessions view are noted as not yet having full functionality.",
    "The inline suggestions consolidation/unification can be reverted via `setting(chat.extensionUnification.enabled)` if issues occur.",
    "The timeline for deprecating the GitHub Copilot extension is mentioned as early 2026; exact dates and migration steps beyond settings are not stated in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "The release frames AI work as session-oriented and multi-provider (Copilot, CLI agents, Codex), pushing toward a unified operational view.",
    "Open-sourcing inline suggestions signals an intentional shift toward transparency and a single, cohesive AI extension surface.",
    "The addition of agent metadata and editor validation suggests custom agents are moving from niche customization to a first-class workflow artifact."
