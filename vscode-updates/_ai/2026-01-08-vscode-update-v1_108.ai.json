  "overview": "VS Code 1.108 (December 2025) is positioned as a December housekeeping-and-polish release, while still delivering targeted improvements for agents, chat session management, accessibility, source control, and the integrated terminal. It also introduces Agent Skills as an experimental customization mechanism.",
  "detailed_explanation": [
    {
      "title": "Agent Skills (Experimental)",
      "bullets": [
        "Introduces Agent Skills as folders of instructions/scripts/resources that can be loaded on-demand by the coding agent.",
        "Skills are discovered from `.github/skills` (and `.claude/skills/` for backwards compatibility) and loaded when relevant.",
        "Requires enabling `setting(chat.useAgentSkills)` to use Agent Skills."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Agent Sessions view improvements",
      "bullets": [
        "Improves the Agent Sessions view with keyboard access for actions (archive/read/open), grouping based on state/age, and bulk archiving.",
        "Adds information on changed files and associated PRs for sessions.",
        "Notes that `setting(chat.viewSessions.orientation)` no longer provides an `auto` option; use `sideBySide` as an alternative."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Chat session navigation and restoration",
      "bullets": [
        "Chat sessions quick pick is now based on the same data as the Agent Sessions view and supports actions like archiving/renaming/deleting.",
        "Chat title control is always visible to quickly switch sessions via the quick pick.",
        "Changes restart behavior: previous sessions are not automatically restored by default; an empty Chat view is shown instead (configurable via `setting(chat.restoreLastPanelSession)`)."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Terminal tool safety and hygiene",
      "bullets": [
        "Expands default auto-approval rules for terminal tool commands when auto approve is enabled (`setting(chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove)`).",
        "Adds UI affordances to allow commands for the current session or workspace.",
        "Prevents terminal tool commands from being added to shell history when shell integration is working (configurable via `setting(chat.tools.terminal.preventShellHistory)`)."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Accessibility improvements",
      "bullets": [
        "Accessible View now streams chat responses dynamically as they are generated.",
        "Excludes MCP server output from the Accessible View by default to reduce noise.",
        "Adds `${activeEditorLanguageId}` variable support for `setting(window.title)` to help accessibility tooling identify the active language."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Editor and productivity updates",
      "bullets": [
        "Supports importing a settings profile by drag-and-drop of a `.code-profile` file.",
        "Adds a Copy Breadcrumbs Path command and allows customizing the separator (`setting(breadcrumbs.symbolPathSeparator)`).",
        "Improves Go to Symbol in Workspace to handle queries containing `#`.",
        "Adds snippet transformations for `snakecase` and `kebabcase`."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Source control enhancements",
      "bullets": [
        "Adds Git blame settings for ignoring whitespace and disabling hover (`setting(git.blame.ignoreWhitespace)`, `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.disableHover)`).",
        "Improves discoverability of commit/cancel actions when authoring commit messages in the editor.",
        "Adds experimental Worktrees node in the Source Control Repositories view (requires enabling repository explorer settings)."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Terminal IntelliSense UX and performance",
      "bullets": [
        "Reworks defaults for terminal IntelliSense: suggestions are still enabled by default but require explicit triggering via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)` rather than showing automatically on type.",
        "Adds UI affordances to re-enable quick suggestions and improves the status bar controls.",
        "Highlights multiple performance/stability improvements (including reduced throttling for large pastes and layout-thrashing fixes).",
        "Extends support for custom glyphs in the GPU-accelerated renderer."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "key_changes": [
    "Agent Skills introduced (Experimental; `setting(chat.useAgentSkills)`).",
    "Agent Sessions view improvements (keyboard access, grouping, PR/changed-files info).",
    "Chat sessions quick pick aligned with Agent Sessions data; chat title control always visible.",
    "Default restart behavior shows an empty Chat view; configurable via `setting(chat.restoreLastPanelSession)`.",
    "Expanded terminal tool auto-approval rules (when enabled) and added allow-for-session/workspace UI.",
    "Terminal tool commands can be excluded from shell history (`setting(chat.tools.terminal.preventShellHistory)`).",
    "Accessible View streams responses; MCP output excluded by default.",
    "Terminal IntelliSense defaults reworked to require explicit trigger (`kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`)."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Agent users: can package and reuse domain workflows via Agent Skills (if enabled).",
    "Users with many chat/agent sessions: easier session navigation and more predictable restoration behavior.",
    "Terminal power users: default suggestion behavior changes to reduce disruption; additional performance improvements benefit heavy terminal usage.",
    "Accessibility users and assistive tooling: improved streaming in Accessible View and clearer app context via language ID in window title.",
    "Git users: more control over blame signal/noise and improved worktree visibility (Experimental)."
  ],
  "caveats": [
    "Agent Skills are explicitly marked Experimental and require enabling `setting(chat.useAgentSkills)`.",
    "Auto-approval rules apply only when terminal tool auto approve is enabled; the article lists example commands but does not claim universal coverage.",
    "Worktrees node in SCM view is Experimental and requires enabling specific SCM settings.",
    "Some terminal performance items reference upstream issues/PRs; precise performance gains are not quantified in the article."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "This release reads like a consolidation step: refining session UX, safety controls, and accessibility rather than adding a single headline feature.",
    "Agent Skills hint at a shift toward modular, reusable agent behavior packaged as artifacts (skills folders), similar to prompting/instructions becoming code-adjacent.",
    "Terminal changes aim to balance discoverability with non-intrusiveness for experienced users (explicit trigger defaults, clearer UI affordances)."

  "confidence": 0.77
